# HyperFile

Description:
HyperFile is a decentralized file storage website that leverages WEB3 technologies to provide users with a secure and private way to store and manage their files. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, HyperFile ensures data integrity, immutability, and transparency.

See the Demo video for more

Key Features:
- Decentralized Storage: Files are stored using decentralized storage protocols, ensuring that data is distributed across multiple nodes and eliminating the risk of a single point of failure.
- Encryption and Security: Files are encrypted client-side before being uploaded, ensuring that only the user has access to their decrypted data.
- WEB3 Integration: Users can connect their Ethereum wallets to seamlessly interact with the platform, including uploading and downloading files, managing   
  permissions, and tracking ownership.
- Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are utilized for file ownership, access control, and payment processing, enabling secure and automated transactions between users.
- User-Friendly Interface: The website provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy file management, search, and organization.
- File Versioning: HyperFile keeps track of file versions, allowing users to restore previous versions and track changes made to their files.
- File Sharing and Collaboration: Users can securely share files with others, set permissions, and collaborate on shared documents.
- Integration with IPFS: HyperFile integrates with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient and decentralized file storage and retrieval.

Technologies Used:
- Vite: A fast and lightweight development build tool for modern web applications.
- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- WEB3: Integration with WEB3 technologies for interacting with the blockchain.
- Solidity: Smart contract development language used for implementing the file storage functionality on the blockchain.
